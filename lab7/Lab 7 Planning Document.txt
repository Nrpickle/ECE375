Use same code for both, just with a define different?

Setup:

- Stack pointer
- Configure I/O 
    The 2 LSBs need to be inputs for the bumper, and the upper 6 MSBs should be input for the remote, B/C the input for the bumbers need to have interrupts attached to them.]
- Configure internal timer/counter interrupt
- Configure USART

Device ID determines where the main code is executed

Sending 128:

On button press, add appropriate two bytes to buffer, debounce (wait)

adding bytes to buffer, busy wait until first is sent, then send second; assume that the debounce wait will take care of the delay for the second.

Receive 128:
6 actions needed on recipient robot
